react-native event source
=========================

Server-Sent Events for your React Native apps! Based on @remy's
[EventSource polyfill](https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/EventSource.js).

## Installing

Run the following command in your project's directory to grab the latest published version of this code:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-event-source --save
```

### Using in your project

```js
import RNEventSource from 'react-native-event-source'
```

Now you're ready to connect to your SSE endpoint and start streaming updates!
:godmode:

```js
const eventSource = new RNEventSource('https://my-sse.com/stream');

eventSource.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  console.log(event.type); // message
  console.log(event.data);
});
```

You can also optionally pass a second argument when initializing `RNEventSource` to pass in header values:

```js
const options = { headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ...' } };
const eventSource = new RNEventSource('https://my-sse.com/stream', options);
```

Here is a full example that subscribes to a SSE stream and writes the results to `console.log`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

import RNEventSource from 'react-native-event-source';

class MyApp extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.eventSource = new EventSource('https://sse.com/stream');

    // Grab all events with the type of 'message'
    this.eventSource.addEventListener('message', (data) => {
      console.log(data.type); // message
      console.log(data.data);
    });

    // Grab connection error events with the type of 'connection-error'
    this.eventSource.addEventListener('connection-error', (data) => {
      console.log(data.message); // message
      console.log(data.status); // http status code
    });
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.eventSource.removeAllListeners();
    this.eventSource.close();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Streaming!</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```
