react-native event source
=========================

Server-Sent Events for your React Native apps! Based on @neilco's
[EventSource](https://github.com/neilco/EventSource).

_NOTE_: This is my first time playing with Obj-C and the iOS ecosystem. If you
see something I'm doing that makes you go :frowning: please let me know. I
:heart: pull requests.

## Installing

Run the following command in your project's directory to grab the latest published version of this code:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-event-source --save
```

### Using in your project

```js
import RNEventSource from 'react-native-event-source'
```

Now you're ready to connect to your SSE endpoint and start streaming updates!
:godmode:

```js
const eventSource = new RNEventSource('https://my-sse.com/stream');

eventSource.addEventListener('message', (event) {
  console.log(event.type); // message
  console.log(event.data);
});
```

Here is a full example that subscribes to a SSE stream and writes the results to `console.log`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

import RNEventSource from 'react-native-event-source';

class MyApp extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.eventSource = new EventSource('https://sse.com/stream');

    // Grab all events with the type of 'message'
    this.eventSource.addEventListener('message', (data) => {
      console.log(data.type); // message
      console.log(data.data);
    });
  }
  componentDidUmnount() {
    this.eventSource.removeAllListeners();
    this.eventSource.close();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Streaming!</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```
