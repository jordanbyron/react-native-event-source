react-native event source
=========================

Server-Sent Events for your React Native apps! Based on @neilco's
[EventSource](https://github.com/neilco/EventSource).

_NOTE_: This is my first time playing with Obj-C and the iOS ecosystem. If you
see something I'm doing that makes you go :frowning: please let me know. I
:heart: pull requests.

## Installing

Run the following command in your project's directory to grab the latest published version of this code:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-event-source --save
```

## Usage

### Linking the Library
In order to use quick actions you must first link the library to your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).

### Using in your project

First, you'll need to make sure `DeviceEventEmitter` is added to the list of
requires for React.

```js
var React = require('react-native');
var {
  //....things you need plus....
  DeviceEventEmitter
} = React;

```

Next grab `RNEventSource` and assign it to a variable.

```js
var EventSource = require('NativeModules').RNEventSource;
```

Now you're ready to connect to your SSE endpoint and start streaming updates!
:godmode:
Use `DeviceEventEmitter` to listen for `EventSourceMessage` messages. You can
also subscribe to `EventSourceConnected` and `EventSourceError` to be notified
when your connection is established or encounters any errors.

```js
var subscription = DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(
  'EventSourceMessage', function(message) {
    console.log(message.event);
    console.log(message.data);
  });

EventSource.connectWithURL("http://your-sse-url.com/stream");
```

Here is a full example that subscribes to a SSE stream and writes the results to `console.log`

```js
var React = require('react-native');
var {
  AppRegistry,
  Text,
  View,
  DeviceEventEmitter,
} = React;

var EventSource = require('NativeModules').RNEventSource,
    subscription;

var MyFancyApp = React.createClass({
  getDefaultProps: function() {
    return {
      url: "http://your-sse-url.com/stream"
    };
  },
  componentDidMount: function() {
    subscription = DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(
      'EventSourceMessage', function(message) {
        console.log(message.event);
      });

    EventSource.connectWithURL(this.props.url);
  },
  componentDidUmnount: function() {
    EventSource.close();
    subscription.remove();
  },
  render: function() {
    return (<View><Text>SSE in React!</Text></View>)
  }
});
```
